How to Play

    Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
        Up Arrow: Move up
        Down Arrow: Move down
        Left Arrow: Move left
        Right Arrow: Move right

    Your objective is to collect as much food as possible. Each time you eat, the snake grows longer, and your score increases.

    Every 20 points, three new barriers will randomly appear on the grid. Avoid colliding with these barriers or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

    Occasionally, a special "big food" will appear. Eat it before it disappears to earn bonus points.

    The game ends when the snake collides with a barrier or itself.

Customization

You can customize the game's settings in the main.js file:

    Canvas Size: Adjust the canvas width and height to change the game area.
    Scale: Modify the scale variable to change the size of the snake and barriers.
    Frame Rate: Change the frameRate variable to speed up or slow down the game.

Restarting the Game

To restart the game after a collision, simply refresh the browser page.
